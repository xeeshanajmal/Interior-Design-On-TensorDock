# Interior Design On TensorDock

This repository contains the codebase for running an interior design application using **Stable Diffusion** and **Streamlit**. The project leverages **TENSORDOCK** servers to run the Automatic1111 WebUI and provides a custom Streamlit app interface to generate new room designs based on user-uploaded images.
